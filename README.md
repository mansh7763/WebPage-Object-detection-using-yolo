# WebPage-Object-detection-using-yolo


## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect various elements on a web page, including:
  Checkboxes, Containers, Dropdown forms, Buttons, Logo images, Navigation dots, Text,  Links, Input fields, Radio buttons

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the YOLO model is a custom dataset from Roboflow Congoz3, consisting of 10 labels:

The YOLO model was trained using the following steps:
Data preparation: The dataset was annotated using the Roboflow annotation tool.
Model selection: The YOLOv8 model was chosen for its accuracy and efficiency.
Training: The model was trained on the annotated dataset using the YOLOv8 training pipeline.
